  fitness and health enthusiast. I believe a healthy body contributes to
  a wealth of good that people don't take seriously enough. A big part
  of me also loves music. I play piano, and have been playing since late
  2022. I'm convinced the music gene runs in the family. \nApart from
  that, I draw, and see myself as quite the artist. I speak Japanese,
  and studied in school, only to pick it back up a little over a year
  ago. And anime is my jam. Specifically comedy / shonen.`;
